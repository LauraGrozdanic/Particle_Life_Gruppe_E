# Particle Simulator 

## Description
This project is a biology-inspired particle simulation that demonstrates emergent behavior through simple interaction rules. Thousands of particles of different types move, attract or repel each other and form visually complex patterns in real time.

This project was developed as part of the course Data Science & AI Infrastructures with a strong focus on professional Python software development.
