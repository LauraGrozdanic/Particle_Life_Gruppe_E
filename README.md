Particle Life Simulator

This project is a Python-based simulation of a Particle Life system.
The idea is to simulate thousands of particles that move and interact based on simple rules.
Different particle types attract or repel each other, and together they create complex, emergent patterns.

Features
Multiple particle types with different interaction behaviors
  -Interaction matrix for attraction and repulsion
  -Real-time or recorded visualization of the simulation
  -Performance optimizations using Python tools
  -Clean and modular code structure
  -Unit tests and continuous integration (CI) support

How to Run
  -Clone the repository
  -Install the required Python packages
  -Run the main simulation script
  -(Optional) Adjust parameters such as interaction strength, friction, or particle types


Team & Workflow
  -We develop this project as a student team using GitHub Issues, branches, pull requests, and a Kanban board.
  -Weekly updates and milestones help track progress.
